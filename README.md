Placeholder repository for the ChipSat-1 project.

Telemetry decoding information, and provisionally source code, to be uploaded here.

## Telemetry coding

| Parameter        | Value                  |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Frequency        | TBD                    |
| Bandwidth        | 20 kHz                 |
| Modulation       | FSK                    |
| Error Correction | None                   |
| Chip Sequence    | DSSS with TBD sequence |
| Bit rate         | TBD                    |

The mission uses the [STM32WL55CC](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32wl55cc.html) transceiver.
